This app generates a random penspinnning combo, using Markow chain trained on Sangkm 13th.  
Sangkm 13th: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4qq_tkwH1E&t=222s

The combos were analyzed and annotated by me in both English and Japanese.  
Codes were almost generated by ChatGPT.

Special thanks to Beige for reviewing the annotations for the combos.
